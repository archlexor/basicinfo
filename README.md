# basicinfo
Information gathering using nmap, crtsh, whois, subfinder and nslookup (linux)

To get started first we will need to install the requiremensts, since this porject isn't that unique and unfamilar i don't think i need to include seperate install script, after all this is a simple but effective script. <br>
---do check the requirements file and install the necessary tools for this script to work.<br>
using whatever package manager you have at your disposal.<br>
```
sudo apt install nmap -y && sudo apt install 
```
