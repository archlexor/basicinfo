Information gathering using nmap, crtsh, whois, subfinder and nslookup (linux)

to get started first we will need to install the requiremensts, since this porject isn't that unique and unfamilar i don't think i need to include seperate install script, after all this is a simple but effective script. 
---do check the requirements file and install the necessary tools for this script to work.
using whatever package manager you have at your disposal.
